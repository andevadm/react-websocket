# React WebSocket Test

This React app presents data received from a WebSocket local server. Current data values and data-time plots are displayed.

Designed for only 2 records in the each received data message. So a simple data structure is used, like variable1 and variable2, but not an array with id-indexed data records.

Different code patterns can be used here for similar tasks in order to demonstrate coding diversity.
